## Things to discuss

- hard to define research questions
- show viewer

    - use kadaster open data
    - points above circle at coordinates
- read about deepforest but not tested yet
- Racine2021 statistical point signature

- want to read more about ML before christmas
- didnt find the time to see why NDVI < 0.4 in subset...

## Questions

- __From Fu2024__:
    ```
    Paper: Instead, when using tree models in higher LoD (LoD2 or LoD3 levels) the differences found for wind predictions in urban areas were rather limited, and therefore less of a concern for researchers when comparing with ground truth data.
    ```

    So diff is low beyond lod2 maybe best to stick to lod2 in my research then?
 - Where to find template P2 to fill?
