# Heading level 1

## heading level 2

###

We can write normally and also use *italic*, **bolt** and ***both***.

***

### lists

there are unorederd lists

- unordered item 
- unordered item 
- ...

and ordered lists

1. ordered list item
2. ordered list item
3. ...

***
### code
`code` looks like this.

I believe I can also write codeblocks like the following:
```python
    import numpy as np

    test = np.ones(3)

    for index, value in enummerate(test):
        print(f'The {index}th value of test is {value}')
```

***
### links
to input links I use [the following syntax](http://www.tudelft.nl).

You can also do raw links using <http://www.tudelft.nl>.
or emails for that matter: <noah@alting.com>.

### checklists
What I was actually really interested in was checklist. These are created as follows:  


- [ ] First thing to do
- [x] Second thing to do (done)

BTW this only works on github?
