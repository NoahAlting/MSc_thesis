# Minutes week 2

## 19-11-2024
10:30 - 11:15  
Noah, Hugo & Clara.


## Practical
- P2 date set to Jan 27th 13:00
- Miro board created to keep track of progress.
- Weekly offline meetings on Tuesday's 10:00. 
    - Alternating Hugo and Clara and we will do once a month with the three of us.
    - Exeption for week 3, it will be Wednesday 27th 12:45.
- Weekly diary in the Miro board


## Questions
- I found a good source for lidar to LAD in R, should I learn R?
    - R is not that hard, probably download and run would be sufficient.

- Is there a rough timeline on literature | coding | writing?
    - Until P2 roughly 50/50 coding vs reading/writing
    - Making mindmaps etc. is good and part of writing process (so not wasted time!)

- Any comments on Zotero vs JebRef?
    - All good, choose what feels best
    - I like Zotero so will use that


## To Do's

- Share Miro board with Hugo and Clara
- Read read read papers for literature study
- Get code from Ivan and start exploring data
- Get some data (AHN5, satellite images?)


## Comments
- Machine learning seems interesting but we need training data and it is not always available. Check if I'm going to use that and whether I can find training data?
