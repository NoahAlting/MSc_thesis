Noah, Clara & Hugo


## What happened last week?

- Hardware issues
- Found dataset
- Mailed boomregister.nl
- first code (NDVI filtering)
- Found some more papers on botany (Mao, Racine, Lee, Xiao, Chen)
- Distractions


## Questions

- Should we set a concrete goal? -- Gantt chart maybe?  
We are going to set some goals per week to solve the misty feeling

- How far to go, with new techniques...  
Thats experience, it takes getting used to. For now just write pro's and con's of a new found technique and discuss it in the weekly meeting.

## To Do's

- [ ] check values of the bands to see why ndvi < 0.4 everywhere (I feel like this is off)
    - maybe in the documentation at beeldmateriaal.nl

- [ ] come up with questions to answer within the thesis (see bigger picture section)

- [ ] Talk with Shenglan Du 
    - about her work at cobra groen inzicht engineering
    - specifically about datasets in NL

- [ ] Make Rerun work on my machine
    - it such a powerful tool so worth it!

- [ ] Run something through DeepForest to check how it works
    - read the paper I found about it

## Bigger picture  

Decide what I want to do in the long run. That's what goes into P2, and now I should test some ideas to see if they are fruitful (or not!).

Some idea's for starters:
- Do I want to use botany information to make 3d tree models?
- focus on finding species from geometry found from data? 
- Make sure model is usable in CFD (maybe test run something?)
- Can I mesh the trees?

Or more coding orientated:
- Instance or semantic segmentation?
- Use Machine learning or not? 



## Some general comments

- The thesis is more a proof of concept and not an all out product that needs to work for everyone!
