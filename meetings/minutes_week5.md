# thesis meeting week 5

## 10-12-2024
10:00 - 11:00  
Noah & Clara

## Discussed topics

- Two research questions defined
    - I thought it was quite hard but it's a start..
- pointcloud viewer works

- tell about idea to set NDVI threshold (see Miro pipeline section)
    - use kadaster open data
    - get all public trees
    - points above circle at coordinates
    - minimization problem

- read about deepforest but not tested yet
    - next thing to do is to try this out

- Found great paper: Racine2021 
    - about tree classification
    - statistical point signature
    - would be nice to test this

- want to read more about ML before christmas

- didnt find the time to see why NDVI < 0.4 in pointcloud...

## Questions

- __From Fu2024__:
    ```
    Paper: Instead, when using tree models in higher LoD (LoD2 or LoD3 levels) the differences found for wind predictions in urban areas were rather limited, and therefore less of a concern for researchers when comparing with ground truth data.
    ```

    So diff is low beyond lod2 maybe best to stick to lod2 in my research then?
    --> for now lets keep it at >lod1 and see later how high.

 - Where to find template P2 to fill? --> just take the template for the thesis and delete chapters unnecessary for P2.


 ## For next week:

 - [ ] test voxelizing like in Kamoske2018 (code in R!)
 - [ ] revisit Hermann2024
 - [ ] Find out the NDVI < 0.4 issue
 - [ ] read 2 papers about ML in pointcloud/areal imagery
 - [ ] Get template in order so I can start to fill some stuff
