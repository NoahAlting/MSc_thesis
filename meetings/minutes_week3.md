## P2
Is about the question: "Can I graduate end of Q4 or not?  
It is a 15 pages report, template is available.
Writing is an essential part of the thesis!

I should:
- be done reading
- know the problem
- which solution(s) I will try
- done some tests with data to see if the solution is feasible

things to remember:
- P2 is roughly 15 pages.
- Template is available.
- Writing is an essential part of the thesis
    - Don't start too late
    - It's the part that's left behind!
- My job to harmonize termonology
- Passive tense is old fashioned so I don't have to stick to it

## Current phase
