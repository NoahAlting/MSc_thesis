## About the topic

- NDVI < 0.4 thing
    - it has nothing to do with the code
    - I fixed the 16bit 32bit drama
    - maybe it has something to do with the resolution  
        - 8cm photo has no NIR (bladloos)
        - 25cm photo has NIR (bladrijk)
        - maybe it takes rgb from 8cm and nir from 25cm but I cant find out what actually happens at geotiles


- tell about idea to set pointcloud filter thresholds (See miro)
    - use kadaster open data (CHECK IF VALID ON MONDAY)
    - points above circle at coordinates

- Racine et al. 2021
    - statistics
    - point density across tree height
    - signature for species
    - in NL better resolution so I expect good results
    - downside: only 4 species?

- Chen et al. 2023
    - ML tree classification
    - UAV and satelite
    - vegetation derivatives (table 3 + figure 7)
    
-  randomforest
    - I've read deeper into it and watch some video's
    - installing randomforest is daunting
    - dont like images because of resolution (prefer lidar)


## About the project
- dont go into ML
    - too much time to learn this instead of doing my reseach itself
    - however, use results from research (use features)

- focus on lidar
    - more interesting
    - comprehensible
    

- Want do build most of my project algorithm myself
    - compromises the time i have, what's your thought?



## Questions

- should I dive more into trees vs porosity params in CFD?
