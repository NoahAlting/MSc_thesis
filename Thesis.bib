	abstract = {The effects of trees on urban flows are often determined using computational fluid dynamics approaches which typically use a quadratic drag formulation based on the leaf-area density \$a\$ and a volumetric drag coefficient \$C\_\{d\}{\textasciicircum}V\$ to model vegetation. In this paper, we develop an analytical model for the flow within a vegetation canopy and identify that the drag length \${\textbackslash}ell\_d = (a C\_d{\textasciicircum}V){\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ is the key metric to describe the local tree drag characteristics. A detailed study of the literature suggests that the median \${\textbackslash}ell\_d\$ observed in field experiments is \$21\$ m for trees and \$0.7\$ m for low vegetation (crops). A total of \$168\$ large-eddy simulations are conducted to obtain a closed form of the analytical model. The model allows determining \$a\$ and \$C\_d{\textasciicircum}V\$ from wind-tunnel experiments that typically present the drag characteristics in terms of the classical drag coefficient \$C\_d\$ and the aerodynamic porosity \$α\_L\$. We show that geometric scaling of \${\textbackslash}ell\_d\$ is the appropriate scaling of trees in wind tunnels. Evaluation of \${\textbackslash}ell\_d\$ for numerical simulations and wind-tunnel experiments (assuming geometric scaling \$1:100\$) in literature shows that the median \${\textbackslash}ell\_d\$ in both these cases is about \$5\$ m, suggesting possible overestimation of vegetative drag.},

However, most of these surveys only use 2D spectral information which normally has not enough clues for ITDD. To fully explore the satellite images, we propose a ITDD method using the orthophoto and digital surface model (DSM) derived from the multi-view satellite data. Our algorithm utilizes the top-hat morphological operation to efficiently extract the local maxima from DSM as treetops, and then feed them to a modi-fied superpixel segmentation that combines both 2D and 3D information for tree crown delineation. In subsequent steps, our method incorporates the biological characteristics of the crowns through plant allometric equation to falsify potential outliers. Experiments against manually marked tree plots on three representative regions have demonstrated promising results - the best overall detection accuracy can be 89\%.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews current parameterizations developed and implemented within Computational Fluid Dynamics models for the study of the effects linking vegetation, mainly trees, to urban air quality and thermal conditions. In the literature, passive mitigation via deposition is parametrized as a volumetric sink term in the transport equation of pollutants, while a volumetric source term is used for particle resuspension. The aerodynamics effects are modelled via source and sink terms of momentum, turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent dissipation rate. A volumetric cooling power is finally considered to account for the thermal (transpirational cooling) effects of vegetation. The most recent applications are also summarized with a focus on the relative importance of both aerodynamic and deposition effects, together with recent studies evaluating thermal effects. Those studies have shown that the aerodynamic effects of trees are stronger than the positive effects of deposition, however locally the pollutant concentration increases or decreases depending on the complex inter-relation between local factors such as vegetation type and density, meteorological conditions, street geometry, pollutant characteristics and emission rates. Unlike aerodynamic and deposition effects on pollutant dispersion which were also found in street far from trees, the thermal effects were in general locally restricted to the close vicinity of the vegetation and to the street canyon itself. Future requirements in CFD modelling include more in depth investigation of resuspension and thermal effects, as well as of the VOCs emissions and chemical reactions. The overall objective of this review is to provide the scientific community with a comprehensive summary on the current parameterizations of urban vegetation in CFD modelling and constitutes the starting point for the development of new parametrizations in CFD as well as in mesoscale models.},

The objective of this study was to develop models relating maximum live branch diameter (MBD), which affects lumber value, to tree and stand characteristics that can be measured through current and emerging remote sensing technologies. Using non-linear mixed effects models for six Canadian conifer species, as well as for three broad-leaved species, MBD was related to crown radius, tree height, crown length, stand basal area, and basal area of trees larger than the subject tree. Models that included only individual tree characteristics (crown radius, tree height, and crown length) did not perform as well as models that additionally included stand characteristics (stand basal area and basal area of larger trees). Models that took into account tree species performed better than models that did not; in particular, broadleaved species had much thicker branches than conifers. The best model did not show bias with respect to independent variables and had root mean square error of 0.32 cm. For the best model, prediction error was not related to silvicultural treatment. These model characteristics strongly support the potential to successfully predict MBD from remotely sensed data.},

	abstract = {Tree allometry is a plastic feature, and scaling parameters can vary considerably depending on phylogeny, life strategies, growth conditions and ontogeny. We hypothesized that in multi-layered forests growing on rich sites and driven by stand dynamics without stand-replacing disturbances, light is a primary driver of allometric relationships and that the morphological plasticity of tree species is closely associated with their shade tolerance. We quantified and compared the morphological properties of six species that form a shade tolerance gradient: Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertner, Quercus robur L., Fraxinus excelsior L., Ulmus laevis Pall., Tilia cordata Miller and Carpinus betulus L. The relationships between tree height and local stand density as predictors and dbh, crown width, crown length and crown volume as response variables were characterized. We found that in the lower stand layer the values of crown parameters increased with tree height at a lower rate in light-adapted than in shade-tolerant species. Conversely, the response of morphological traits on competition was stronger in light-adapted species than in shade-tolerant species. The ratio of crown width-to-crown length was not associated with light demand. Apart from ash, which demonstrated a different allocation pattern, between-species differences in the slenderness ratio were insignificant. Allometry and sensitivity to competition varied in trees growing in the upper and lower stand layers. Our results indicate that the dichotomy of basic growth strategies of stress tolerance versus stress avoidance is overly simplistic and fails to consider social status and species-specific features such as apical control.},

	abstract = {The modeling of trees represents a unique and classical challenge in computer graphics. Models of 3D trees must express the form, complexity, structure, growth and diversity of real trees. Presently the most common methods for the modeling of 3D trees include a) user-based creative modeling, b) direct geometric capture such as LIDAR and photogrammetry, or c) indirect methods such as machine learning from images. These techniques often require significant human effort, large amounts of data, considerable computation resources, or any of the above. While there are methods that consider the direct procedural generation of trees, current models often require some human supervision to focus on naturally plausible variants. Instead, our approach is to construct a botanically-inspired, harmonic, procedural model for trees which directly produces realistic yet diverse trees.},

	title = {A graph cut approach to {3D} tree delineation, using integrated airborne {LiDAR} and hyperspectral imagery},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06715},
	abstract = {Recognising individual trees within remotely sensed imagery has important applications in forest ecology and management. Several algorithms for tree delineation have been suggested, mostly based on locating local maxima or inverted basins in raster canopy height models (CHMs) derived from Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) data or photographs. However, these algorithms often lead to inaccurate estimates of forest stand characteristics due to the limited information content of raster CHMs. Here we develop a 3D tree delineation method which uses graph cut to delineate trees from the full 3D LiDAR point cloud, and also makes use of any optical imagery available (hyperspectral imagery in our case). First, conventional methods are used to locate local maxima in the CHM and generate an initial map of trees. Second, a graph is built from the LiDAR point cloud, fused with the hyperspectral data. For computational efficiency, the feature space of hyperspectral imagery is reduced using robust PCA. Third, a multi-class normalised cut is applied to the graph, using the initial map of trees to constrain the number of clusters and their locations. Finally, recursive normalised cut is used to subdivide, if necessary, each of the clusters identified by the initial analysis. We call this approach Multiclass Cut followed by Recursive Cut (MCRC). The effectiveness of MCRC was tested using three datasets: i) NewFor, ii) a coniferous forest in the Italian Alps, and iii) a deciduous woodland in the UK. The performance of MCRC was usually superior to that of other delineation methods, and was further improved by including high-resolution optical imagery. Since MCRC delineates the entire LiDAR point cloud in 3D, it allows individual crown characteristics to be measured. By making full use of the data available, graph cut has the potential to considerably improve the accuracy of tree delineation.},

In this study, the subtropical natural forest in northwest Yunnan province of China was selected as the study area. Firstly, an object-oriented multi-resolution segmentation (MRS) algorithm was used to segment individual tree crowns from the UAV RGB imagery and satellite multispectral imagery in the forests with different densities (low (547 n/ha), middle (753 n/ha) and high (1040 n/ha)), and parameters of the MRS algorithm were tested and optimized for accurately extracting the tree crown and position information of the individual tree. Secondly, the texture metrics of the UAV RGB imagery and the spectral metrics of the satellite multispectral imagery within the individual tree crown were extracted, and the random forest algorithm and three deep learning networks constructed in this study were utilized to classify the five dominant tree species. Finally, we compared and evaluated the performance of the random forest algorithm and three deep learning networks for dominant tree species classification using the field measurement data, and the influence of the number of training samples on the accuracy of dominant tree species classification using deep learning networks was investigated. The results showed that: (1) Stand density had little influence on individual tree segmentation using the object-oriented MRS algorithm. In the forests with different stand densities, the F1 score of individual tree segmentation based on satellite multispectral imagery was 71.3–74.7\%, and that based on UAV high-resolution RGB imagery was 75.4–79.2\%. (2) The overall accuracy of dominant tree species classification using the light-weight network MobileNetV2 (OA = 71.11–82.22\%), residual network ResNet34 (OA = 78.89–91.11\%) and dense network DenseNet121 (OA = 81.11–94.44\%) was higher than that of the random forest algorithm (OA = 60.00–64.44\%), among which DenseNet121 had the highest overall accuracy. Texture metrics improved the overall accuracy of dominant tree species classification. (3) For the three deep learning networks, the changes in overall accuracy of dominant tree species classification influenced by the number of training samples were 2.69–4.28\%.},

The vertical structure is often summarized by scalar features and data-reduction techniques that limit the interpretation of results. Instead, we quantified the influence of three variables, species, crown cover, and age, on the vertical distribution of airborne LiDAR returns from forest stands. We studied 5,428 regular, even-aged stands in Quebec (Canada) with five dominant species: balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.), paper birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh), black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP), white spruce (Picea glauca Moench) and aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.). We modeled the vertical distribution against the three variables using a functional general linear model and a novel nonparametric graphical test of significance. Results indicate that LiDAR returns from aspen stands had the most uniform vertical distribution. Balsam fir and white birch distributions were similar and centered at around 50\% of the stand height, and black spruce and white spruce distributions were skewed to below 30\% of stand height (p\&lt;0.001). Increased crown cover concentrated the distributions around 50\% of stand height. Increasing age gradually shifted the distributions higher in the stand for stands younger than 70-years, before plateauing and slowly declining at 90-120 years. Results suggest that the vertical distributions of LiDAR returns depend on the three variables studied.},

Although some LiDAR satellites such as GEDI and ICESAT-2 can measure the average tree height in a certain area, there is still a lack of effective means for obtaining individual tree parameters using high-resolution satellite data, especially DBH. The objective of this study is to explore the capability of 2D image-based features (texture and spectrum) in estimating the DBH of individual tree. Firstly, we acquired unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) LiDAR point cloud data and UAV RGB imagery, from which digital aerial photography (DAP) point cloud data were generated using the structure-from-motion (SfM) method. Next, we performed individual tree segmentation and extracted the individual tree crown boundaries using the DAP and LiDAR point cloud data, respectively. Subsequently, the eight 2D image-based textural and spectral metrics and 3D point-cloud-based metrics (tree height and crown diameters) were extracted from the tree crown boundaries of each tree. Then, the correlation coefficients between each metric and the reference DBH were calculated. Finally, the capabilities of these metrics and different models, including multiple linear regression (MLR), random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM), in the DBH estimation were quantitatively evaluated and compared. The results showed that: (1) The 2D image-based textural metrics had the strongest correlation with the DBH. Among them, the highest correlation coefficient of −0.582 was observed between dissimilarity, variance and DBH. When using textural metrics alone, the estimated DBH accuracy was the highest, with a RMSE of only 0.032 and RMSE\% of 16.879\% using the MLR model; (2) Simply feeding multi-features, such as textural, spectral and structural metrics, into the machine learning models could not have led to optimal results in individual tree DBH estimations; on the contrary, it could even reduce the accuracy. In general, this study indicated that the 2D image-based textural metrics have great potential in individual tree DBH estimations, which could help improve the capability to efficiently and meticulously monitor and manage forests on a large scale.},

                    Remote sensing of forested landscapes can transform the speed, scale and cost of forest research. The delineation of individual trees in remote sensing images is an essential task in forest analysis. Here we introduce a new
                    Python
                    package, DeepForest that detects individual trees in high resolution RGB imagery using deep learning.
                  
                
                
                  While deep learning has proven highly effective in a range of computer vision tasks, it requires large amounts of training data that are typically difficult to obtain in ecological studies. DeepForest overcomes this limitation by including a model pretrained on over 30 million algorithmically generated crowns from 22 forests and fine‐tuned using 10,000 hand‐labelled crowns from six forests.
                
                
                  The package supports the application of this general model to new data, fine tuning the model to new datasets with user labelled crowns, training new models and evaluating model predictions. This simplifies the process of using and retraining deep learning models for a range of forests, sensors and spatial resolutions.
                
                
                  We illustrate the workflow of DeepForest using data from the National Ecological Observatory Network, a tropical forest in French Guiana, and street trees from Portland, Oregon.},

Our objective was to determine the optimal values for reliable and stable estimates of LAD profiles from ALS data obtained over a dense tropical forest. Profiles were compared using three methods: Destructive field sampling, Portable Canopy profiling Lidar (PCL) and ALS. Stable LAD profiles from ALS, concordant with the other two analytical methods, were obtained when the grain size was less than 10 m and pulse density was high ({\textgreater}15 pulses m−2). Lower pulse densities also provided stable and reliable LAD profiles when using an appropriate adjustment (coefficient K). We also discuss how LAD profiles might be corrected throughout the landscape when using ALS surveys of lower density, by calibrating with LAI measurements in the field or from PCL. Appropriate choices of grain size, pulse density and K provide reliable estimates of LAD and associated tree plot demography and biomass in dense forest ecosystems.},

            Eine Überwachung und Dokumentation von Bäumen ist sehr arbeitsaufwändig. Lidar bietet das Potential für automatische Bauminventur. Es gibt Ansätze zur Segmentierung von Bäumen aus Punktwolken, die allerdings noch nicht in der Lage sind, einzelne Bäume in Punktwolken verschiedener Lidar‐Systeme zuverlässig und mit ausreichender Qualität unter vielfältigen realen Bedingungen zu separieren. Diese Studie stellt einen neuen Algorithmus zur effizienten Erfassung von Bäumen in Lidar‐Punktwolken dar. Der Algorithmus bildet Punkte mit Hilfe von quaderförmigen (Voxel) Zellen um. Nacheinander verbundene Zellen werden durch vertikale Traverse der Zellschichten akkumuliert. Bäume in nächster Nachbarschaft werden durch eine neuartige Zellanalyse identifiziert. Der Vorteil der Skalierbarkeit des Algorithmus wird an flugzeuggestützten, mobilen und terrestrischen Laserscanpunktwolken validiert. Anhand von Solldaten ist festzustellen, dass bei gleicher Rechenzeit, eine Verbesserung von 89\% bis 94\% im Vergleich zu aktuellen Verfahren erzielt werden kann.

Los enfoques existentes para segmentar árboles a partir originalmente de nubes de puntos lidar carecen de métodos escalables y eficientes que separen árboles individuales muestreados por diferentes sistemas lidar con calidad suficiente bajo todas las circunstancias.

El algoritmo propuesto primero remuestrea los puntos usando células cuboides (vóxels). Los vóxels adyacentes se acumulan atravesando verticalmente las capas de vóxels. Basados en un nuevo análisis de adyacencia de vóxels se identifican árboles que están próximos. El rendimiento escalable de este algoritmo se valida con nubes de puntos lidar aerotransportados, móviles y terrestres. La validación con verdad terreno demuestra una mejora del 89\% al 94\% en comparación con un método de vanguardia, mientras que el tiempo de cálculo es similar.

	abstract = {Trees are a crucial component of urban environments. However, accurately identifying and segmenting individual street trees from Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) point clouds in complex urban scenes remains a significant challenge due to low accuracy and poor robustness. Additionally, traditional manual extraction methods are labor-intensive and time-consuming. To address these issues, this paper proposes a method for the automatic extraction and segmentation of urban street trees using MLS point cloud data. The preprocessing phase initially filters out ground and building points to reduce computational complexity. Subsequently, coarse extraction is performed using projection density, and a method based on spatial morphology and elevation slice frequency statistics is employed to differentiate other objects and cluster street trees. Next, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm is employed to initialize the potential tree trunk point cloud, and precise identification of tree trunks is achieved through the application of circular arc curvature and a layered circular fitting model. Finally, a combination of neighborhood-based connectivity coefficients and a shortest path constraint method is utilized to accurately segment multiple overlapping street trees. Evaluation results from multiple sets of experimental datasets indicate that the proposed algorithm achieves a high level of accuracy in trunk extraction, resulting in clearer outlines of the segmented tree crowns. The detection accuracy and precision of individual tree clusters are approximately 95.3\% and 96.7\%, respectively, presenting more robust segmentation results compared to mainstream methods. This contributes significantly to providing crucial technical references for urban tree census and statistics.},

This task is particularly challenging for real-world acquisitions due to factors, such as noise, outliers, non-uniform sampling, and missing data. Traditional approaches often simplify the problem by imposing handcrafted priors on either the input point clouds or the resulting surface, a process that can require tedious hyperparameter tuning. In contrast, deep learning models have the capability to directly learn the properties of input point clouds and desired surfaces from data. We study the influence of handcrafted and learned priors on the precision and robustness of surface reconstruction techniques. We evaluate various time-tested and contemporary methods in a standardized manner. When both trained and evaluated on point clouds with identical characteristics, the learning-based models consistently produce higher-quality surfaces compared to their traditional counterparts—even in scenarios involving novel shape categories. However, traditional methods demonstrate greater resilience to the diverse anomalies commonly found in real-world 3D acquisitions. For the benefit of the research community, we make our code and datasets available, inviting further enhancements to learning-based surface reconstruction.},

Despite this, open data on the number of floors is currently not available at a nationwide level in the Netherlands. This means that it must be inferred from other available data.

Furthermore, a comparison is made between features derived from 3D building models at different levels of detail. {\textless}br/{\textgreater}{\textless}br/{\textgreater}The results show that building height, particularly 70th percentile height, is most related to the number of floors. Other 3D geometric features are also found to be quite closely related to the number of floors, specifically roof area and volume. However, a higher level of detail did not improve the results. Cadastral features are also found to be relevant; mainly net internal area and, to a lesser extent, construction year. Furthermore, models based on a combination of different features performed better than models based on single categories of features.{\textless}br/{\textgreater}{\textless}br/{\textgreater}The best predictive model achieved an accuracy of 94.5\% and a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.06 for buildings with 5 floors or less. This represented a substantial improvement on the results of the geometric approach, which had an accuracy of 69.9\% and MAE of 0.31. However, above 5 floors, model performance was substantially lower. Machine learning provided only a slight improvement on the geometric approach for these buildings. In this case, the best model had an accuracy of 52.3\% and MAE of 0.62, whereas the geometric approach was 47.5\% accurate and had a MAE of 0.70. A comparison of the cumulative error distributions showed that the best model mainly improved the fraction of buildings that were predicted with an error of less than 1 floor.

	abstract = {Spatially explicit information on tree species composition of managed and natural forests, plantations and urban vegetation provides valuable information for nature conservationists as well as for forest and urban managers and is frequently required over large spatial extents. Over the last four decades, advances in remote sensing technology have enabled the classification of tree species from several sensor types. While studies using remote sensing data to classify and map tree species reach back several decades, a recent review on the status, potentials, challenges and outlooks in this realm is missing. Here, we search for major trends in remote sensing techniques for tree species classification and discuss the effectiveness of different sensors and algorithms based on a literature review. This review demonstrates that the number of studies focusing on tree species classification has increased constantly over the last four decades and promising local scale approaches have been presented for several sensor types. However, there are few examples for tree species classifications over large geographic extents, and bridging the gap between current approaches and tree species inventories over large geographic extents is still one of the biggest challenges of this research field. Furthermore, we found only few studies which systematically described and examined the traits that drive the observed variance in the remote sensing signal and thereby enable or hamper species classifications. Most studies followed data-driven approaches and pursued an optimization of classification accuracy, while a concrete hypothesis or a targeted application was missing in all but a few exceptional studies. We recommend that future research efforts focus stronger on the causal understanding of why tree species classification approaches work under certain conditions or – maybe even more important - why they do not work in other cases. This might require more complex field acquisitions than those typically used in the reviewed studies. At the same time, we recommend reducing the number of purely data-driven studies and algorithm-benchmarking studies as these studies are of limited value, especially if the experimental design is limited, e.g. the tree population is not representative and only a few sensors or acquisition settings are simultaneously investigated.},

From the National Forest Inventory data, we extracted the tree positions, filtered 387 775 trees in the upper canopy layer, and automatically extracted the corresponding bottom-of-atmosphere reflectance time series from Sentinel-2 L2A images. These time series are labeled with the corresponding tree species, which allows pixel-wise classification tasks. Furthermore, we provide auxiliary information such as the approximate tree position, the year of possible disturbance events, or the diameter at breast height. Temporally, the dataset spans the years from July 2015 to the end of October 2022, with approx. 75.3 million data points for trees of 48 species and 3 species groups as well as 13.8 million observations for non-tree backgrounds. Spatially, it covers the whole of Germany. The dataset is available at the following DOI (Freudenberg et al., 2024): https://doi.org/10.3220/DATA20240402122351-0.},

	abstract = {Different urban planting contexts, such as streets and parks, can lead to significant intraspecific biochemical and structural variations in trees. These variations present challenges for remote sensing-based tree species classification and effective urban forest management. However, few studies have explored how planting contexts influence the accuracy of remote sensing-based tree species identification in urban environments. This study introduced a planting context-specific modelling approach (i.e., models trained for street trees and park trees separately) for classifying seven dominant broadleaved tree species in the Brussels Capital Region, Belgium using airborne hyperspectral and leaf-on LiDAR data. This approach was compared to a traditional general modelling approach. Linear discriminant analysis with principal component analysis was employed to classify tree species at the individual tree level using different feature sets. Our results showed that a planting context-specific modelling approach with combined hyperspectral and LiDAR features achieved an overall accuracy (OA) of 84.2\%. It improved the OA of LiDAR-based classifications by 7.6 and 8.9 percentage points for street trees and park trees respectively and of hyperspectral-based street tree species classification by 4.2 percentage points. The decreased discriminatory power of features in general models can be partly attributed to their sensitivity to planting context. We concluded that a planting context-specific modeling approach can enhance urban tree species classification, ultimately supporting improved urban forest management.},

The network is mainly composed of two parts: a sampling component in the early stage and a feature extraction component in the later stage. We used geometric sampling to extract regions with local features from the tree contours since these tend to be species-specific. Then we used an improved Farthest Point Sampling method to extract the features from a global perspective. We input the intensity of the tree point cloud as a dimensional feature and spatial information into the neural network and mapped it to higher dimensions for feature extraction. We used the data obtained by Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Laser Scanning (UAVLS) to conduct tree species classification experiments of white birch and larch. The experimental results showed that in both the TLS and UAVLS datasets, the input tree point cloud density and the highest feature dimensionality of the mapping had an impact on the classification accuracy of the tree species. When the single tree sample obtained by TLS consisted of 1024 points and the highest dimension of the network mapping was 512, the classification accuracy of the trained model reached 96\%. For the individual tree samples obtained by UAVLS, which consisted of 2048 points and had the highest dimension of the network mapping of 1024, the classification accuracy of the trained model reached 92\%. TLS data tree species classification accuracy of PCTSCN was improved by 2–9\% compared with other models using the same point density, amount of data and highest feature dimension. The classification accuracy of tree species obtained by UAVLS was up to 8\% higher. We propose PCTSCN to provide a new strategy for the intelligent classification of forest tree species.},

	abstract = {Aerosol scatters solar radiation before it reaches the surface and scatters and absorbs it again after it is reflected from the surface and before it reaches the satellite sensor. The effect is spectrally and spatially dependent. Therefore, atmospheric aerosol (dust, smoke, and air pollution particles) has a significant effect on remote sensing. Correction for the aerosol effect on remote sensing of land areas was never achieved on an operational basis though several case studies were demonstrated. We distinguish between direct correction, in which the aerosol loading is derived from the image itself (or supplied from external sources) followed by correction of the image using an appropriate radiative transfer model, and indirect correction, achieved by defining remote sensing functions that are less dependent on the aerosol loading. To some degree this was already achieved in global remote sensing of vegetation where a composite of several days of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) measurements, choosing the maximal value, was used instead of a single cloud-screened value. The atmospheric resistant vegetation index (ARVI) introduced recently for the Earth Observing System (EOS) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is the most appropriate example of indirect correction, where the index is defined in such a way that the atmospheric effect in a blue spectral channel cancels to a large degree the atmospheric effect in the red channel in computations of the vegetation index. Atmospheric corrections can also use aerosol climatology or simultaneous measurements with ground-based instrumentation. These aspects of aerosol studies and remote sensing are reviewed in this article. New advances in ground-based instrumentation and future satellite systems (including measurements of polarization) are discussed. In the conclusions a strategy is introduced for a combination of ground-based measurements, with direct and indirect corrections that is implemented for the EOS-MODIS and recommended for other similar platforms. Such strategy, planned in advance, is a first step to face the challenge and take advantage of the opportunities that the remote sensing community will face with the launch of EOS and ADEOS in the next several years.},

	abstract = {A growing number of studies have focused on evaluating spectral indices in terms of their sensitivity to vegetation biophysical parameters, as well as to external factors affecting canopy reflectance. In this context, leaf and canopy radiative transfer models are valuable for modeling and understanding the behavior of such indices. In the present work, PROSPECT and SAILH models have been used to simulate a wide range of crop canopy reflectances in an attempt to study the sensitivity of a set of vegetation indices to green leaf area index (LAI), and to modify some of them in order to enhance their responsivity to LAI variations. The aim of the paper was to present a method for minimizing the effect of leaf chlorophyll content on the prediction of green LAI, and to develop new algorithms that adequately predict the LAI of crop canopies. Analyses based on both simulated and real hyperspectral data were carried out to compare performances of existing vegetation indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index [NDVI], Renormalized Difference Vegetation Index [RDVI], Modified Simple Ratio [MSR], Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index [SAVI], Soil and Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index [SARVI], MSAVI, Triangular Vegetation Index [TVI], and Modified Chlorophyll Absorption Ratio Index [MCARI]) and to design new ones (MTVI1, MCARI1, MTVI2, and MCARI2) that are both less sensitive to chlorophyll content variations and linearly related to green LAI. Thorough analyses showed that the above existing vegetation indices were either sensitive to chlorophyll concentration changes or affected by saturation at high LAI levels. Conversely, two of the spectral indices developed as a part of this study, a modified triangular vegetation index (MTVI2) and a modified chlorophyll absorption ratio index (MCARI2), proved to be the best predictors of green LAI. Related predictive algorithms were tested on CASI (Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager) hyperspectral images and, then, validated using ground truth measurements. The latter were collected simultaneously with image acquisition for different crop types (soybean, corn, and wheat), at different growth stages, and under various fertilization treatments. Prediction power analysis of proposed algorithms based on MCARI2 and MTVI2 resulted in agreements between modeled and ground measurement of non-destructive LAI, with coefficients of determination (r2) being 0.98 for soybean, 0.89 for corn, and 0.74 for wheat. The corresponding RMSE for LAI were estimated at 0.28, 0.46, and 0.85, respectively.},

	abstract = {Wildfires are a dominant disturbance to boreal forests, and in North America, they typically cause widespread tree mortality. Forest fire burn severity is often measured at a plot scale using the Composite Burn Index (CBI), which was originally developed as a means of assigning severity levels to the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) computed from Landsat satellite imagery. Our study investigated the potential to map biophysical indicators of burn severity (residual green vegetation and charred organic surface) at very high (3 cm) resolution, using color orthomosaics and vegetation height models derived from UAV-based photographic surveys and Structure from Motion methods. These indicators were scaled to 30 m resolution Landsat pixel footprints and compared to the post-burn NBR (post-NBR) and differenced NBR (dNBR) ratios computed from pre- and post-fire Landsat imagery. The post-NBR showed the strongest relationship to both the fraction of charred surface (exponential R2 = 0.79) and the fraction of green crown vegetation above 5 m (exponential R2 = 0.81), while the dNBR was more closely related to the total green vegetation fraction (exponential R2 = 0.69). Additionally, the UAV green fraction and Landsat indices could individually explain more than 50\% of the variance in the overall CBI measured in 39 plots. These results provide a proof-of-concept for using low-cost UAV photogrammetric mapping to quantify key measures of boreal burn severity at landscape scales, which could be used to calibrate and assign a biophysical meaning to Landsat spectral indices for mapping severity at regional scales.},

	abstract = {Leaf Area Index, LAI, the total surface area of leaves per unit of ground area (m2 m−2), is a collective measure of the foliar portion of vegetation canopy structure. The measure underscores the primacy of surface area in many fundamental processes of vegetation-environment interactions. Since its definition by Watson in 1947, LAI has been used to aggregate leaf level characteristics throughout the canopy to the crop or stand level, predict light regimes, assess the total quantity of above ground biomass and estimate the primary production in vegetation among other uses. This property is widely cited as a central parameter in ecosystem or earth system models of production, for schemes to parameterize vegetative surface interactions in climate models and for large-scale estimates of other surface properties. The value of LAI is sensitive to a variety of factors. At a global scale it is related to climate and plant functional type. At a local scale it is affected by weather and site factors such as fertility, stand age, management treatment, disturbance history. It is a difficult quantity to measure, principally because only part of the total is readily apparent. The indirect measurement approaches are affected by several distinct factors: viewpoint effects, occlusion of surfaces and the presence of material that is not green foliage. Much effort has been spent to estimate those hidden parts. Here I review the history of this measure and related ecosystem structure and process concepts, discuss how this structural characteristic has been connected to light distribution, material and energy exchange and used to model a variety of vegetation functions. Although the concept has been applied at the leaf, branch and whole-tree basis, I focus here on canopy and ecosystem scales, mostly in forests. The principal theses are that while LAI is a fundamental characteristic of vegetation and the result of considerable energetic investment by the plants: (1) the absolute value of the index is not always a clear driver of biomass or production, (2) the details of leaf area organization in space and within microclimate gradients is far more important than is the total amount of leaf area and (3) the total LAI can include leaf areas spanning a range of species, strategies and behaviors whose aggregate behavior is a challenge to model. I argue that (1) the value of LAI may be considered more of a consequence than a cause of canopy structural attributes and (2) the total LAI may be considered to have a range of functions, from ecosystem production to sustaining a diversity of biological strategies. Scaling of processes dependent on leaf area is a significant challenge and simple aggregation schemes can be misleading. I suggest that much of the total LAI (beyond about LAI {\textasciitilde} 3) may not be directly relevant for many ecosystem processes but have other important consequences. I illustrate this idea with several examples and suggest some questions related to LAI that might be profitably studied.},
